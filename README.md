# scriptsForPypeIt_DEIMOS
This repo contains scripts to assist in reduction of DEIMOS slit masks with PypeIt. The scripts are designed to be ran on UCSC's Lux cluster, and handle creation of PypeIt files for 1d and 2d coadding, as well as reformatting the resulting coadded files. I reduced data from DEIMOS using PypeIt 1.10, and these scripts should be compatible with reduction done with mosaics or individual detectors.
